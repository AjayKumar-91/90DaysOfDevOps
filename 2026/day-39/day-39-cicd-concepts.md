# Day 39 – What is CI/CD?

## Challenge Tasks

### Task 1: The Problem
Think about a team of 5 developers all pushing code to the same repo manually deploying to production.

Write in your notes:
1. What can go wrong?
2. What does "it works on my machine" mean and why is it a real problem?
3. How many times a day can a team safely deploy manually?

---

### Task 2: CI vs CD
Research and write short definitions (2-3 lines each):
1. **Continuous Integration** — what happens, how often, what it catches
2. **Continuous Delivery** — how it's different from CI, what "delivery" means
3. **Continuous Deployment** — how it differs from Delivery, when teams use it

Write one real-world example for each.

### Task 3: Pipeline Anatomy
A pipeline has these parts — write what each one does:
- **Trigger** — what starts the pipeline
- **Stage** — a logical phase (build, test, deploy)
- **Job** — a unit of work inside a stage
- **Step** — a single command or action inside a job
- **Runner** — the machine that executes the job
- **Artifact** — output produced by a job

---

### Task 4: Draw a Pipeline
Draw a CI/CD pipeline for this scenario:
> A developer pushes code to GitHub. The app is tested, built into a Docker image, and deployed to a staging server.
Developer
   │
   │ Push Code
   ▼
GitHub Repository
   │
   │ Trigger Pipeline
   ▼
CI/CD Pipeline
-------------------------------------------------
Stage 1: Build
    └── Install dependencies
    └── Build application

Stage 2: Test
    └── Run unit tests
    └── Run lint checks

Stage 3: Docker Build
    └── Build Docker image
    └── Push image to DockerHub

Stage 4: Deploy
    └── Deploy container to staging server
-------------------------------------------------

Result:
Application running on Staging Server
Include at least 3 stages. Hand-drawn and photographed is perfectly fine.

### Task 5: Explore in the Wild
1. Open any popular open-source repo on GitHub (Kubernetes, React, FastAPI — pick one you know)
2. Find their `.github/workflows/` folder
3. Open one workflow YAML file
4. Write in your notes:
   - What triggers it?
   - How many jobs does it have?
   - What does it do? (best guess)
